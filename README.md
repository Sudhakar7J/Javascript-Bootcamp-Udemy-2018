# Javascript-Bootcamp-Udemy-2018
Who’s this course for?

1. People who are brand new to JavaScript. You want to dive into the world of programming and learn JavaScript. This might be your first programming course, or maybe you’ve worked with other languages before. Either way, you’re ready for this bootcamp.

2. People who currently use JavaScript but want a better sense of mastery over the language. You picked up little tricks and snippets of code because you needed to solve a problem. Now you’re ready to master JavaScript as well as explore the latest from ES6 and ES7.

You’ll learn JavaScript by doing, not watching.

This course is not about watching videos, it’s about writing code. From the start, you’ll be building out each project from scratch as well as completing over 80 challenges designed to test and reinforce what you’ve learned.

During the class, you’ll build three JavaScript applications:

1. The first app, a note-taking app, is our starter application. You’ll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript and see exactly what it takes to build a program that allows users to add, edit, delete, and save their notes.

2. The second app, a to-do application, you’ll be building on your own. This will test your skills and ensure that you have the real-world experience and problem-solving skills that are essential for writing JavaScript code.

3. The last app, a hangman word game, is used to explore the world of asynchronous JavaScript. You’ll learn how to set up applications that rely on data from third-party services that can offer up dynamic, real-time information such as the user’s current location.

Stay current in an ever changing world.

The world of JavaScript is always changing, and that’s why I work to keep this course as up-to-date as possible. You can join knowing you’ll be learning the fundamentals of the language as well as the new language features that keep coming out.

This course uses the latest language features from ES6 and ES7.

Everything you need comes in one easy-to-use package.

There’s no need to worry if you’re learning the right skills to land that JavaScript job or launch that JavaScript app. I’ve mapped out everything you need to know in an interactive, easy-to-follow package designed to get you up and running in a couple of weeks.

By the end, you’ll be able to build and launch your own applicatio
